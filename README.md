## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Data set used in the project is available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBNB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. How much of seasonality premiums are there in AirBNB rentals?
2. What proportion of AirBNB rentals charge seasonality premium?
3. What factors if any have correlations with seasonality premiums.

## File Descriptions

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/2c267e176cc1).
